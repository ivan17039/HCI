# üè° Apartment Rental Web Application

# üìñ Project Overview

This is a **Next.js-based apartment rental web application** that allows users to explore available apartments, check availability, make reservations, and leave reviews. The project ensures a fully responsive and interactive experience.
This report summarizes the development process and features of a responsive apartment rental website landing page, created as part of a multi-part assignment. The project involved creating low and high-fidelity prototypes, coding a fully responsive page, and implementing dynamic functionality based on user login.The project ensures a fully responsive and interactive experience. The development was completed in multiple stages:

# üé® Basic Design Principles

Throughout our project, we applied several basic design principles to enhance user experience and interface design:

1. Maintained a uniform color scheme, typography, and button styles across all pages.

2. Used size and color emphasis for important elements like headings and call-to-action buttons.
3. Ensured readability through distinct text and background contrasts.
4. Structured layout with clear alignment of form elements, buttons, and text.
5. Grouped related elements together, such as labels with their input fields.

# üß† Norman's 7 Strategies

We incorporated Donald Norman's 7 principles of design in the following ways:

1. Discoverability: Navigation elements and form inputs are easily visible and labeled.

2. Feedback: Buttons provide hover states to indicate interactivity.
3. Conceptual Model: Layout follows common web conventions, making it intuitive.
4. Affordances: Buttons appear clickable, and input fields are clearly editable.
5. Signifiers: Labels and placeholders guide users through form fields.
6. Mappings: Logical ordering of form fields aligns with users' expectations.
7. Constraints: Required fields prevent errors and guide users towards successful input.

# üîç Heuristic Evaluation

Applying Nielsen's heuristics, we evaluated our design as follows:

1. Visibility of System Status: The active page is highlighted in the navigation.

2. Match Between System and Real World: Uses familiar terms like "Book Now" and "Reservations".
3. User Control and Freedom: Users can navigate freely and modify their bookings.
4. Consistency and Standards: Maintains consistent UI patterns across pages.
5. Error Prevention: Input validation helps prevent user errors.
6. Recognition Rather Than Recall: Labels and placeholders reduce cognitive load.
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Navigation provides quick access to key sections.
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: Focuses on clarity and simplicity.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: Clear error messages guide users.
10. Help and Documentation: Key sections provide guidance on using the site.

You're right, and I understand now that you want the bullet points indented further to the right. Here's the corrected version with the bullet points indented:

Ah, I see now. You want the sub-points to be numbered instead of using bullet points, and you want them indented. Here's the corrected version that matches your example:

# üîé C.R.A.P. Principles

We applied the C.R.A.P. (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) principles as follows:

**1. Contrast:**

- Used distinct text/background colors.
- Applied different font weights for headings.

**2. Repetition:**

- Consistent button styles across pages.
- Maintained a uniform layout structure.

**3. Alignment:**

- Left-aligned form labels and input fields.
- Centered form containers for clarity.

**4. Proximity:**

- Grouped related elements closely.
- Navigation items kept together in the header.

  - Send email confirmations after booking.
  - Implement push notifications for booking reminders.

# üèÜ Conclusion üéâ

This project successfully delivered a fully functional and responsive landing page with integrated backend functionality. The use of various technologies and a focus on the booking process resulted in a robust and user-friendly application. The architecture is scalable and adaptable for future expansion, including server-side data fetching and additional features.
